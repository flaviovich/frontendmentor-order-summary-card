# Frontend Mentor - Order Summary Card

![Screenshot of the Order Summary Card](assets/screenshot.png)

This is a solution to the [Order Summary Card challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj) on Frontend Mentor.

## Overview

A responsive order summary card built with Tailwind CSS, following the design and requirements from Frontend Mentor. The card displays a summary of a subscription plan, including plan details, price, and action buttons.

## Features
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Custom colors and shadows using Tailwind CSS
- Google Fonts integration (Red Hat Display)
- Accessible buttons and links

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Google Fonts

## Getting Started

1. Clone only the `tailwind` branch:
  ```sh
  git clone --branch tailwind https://github.com/flaviovich/frontendmentor-order-summary-card.git
  ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Why tailwind.config.js is necessary

The `tailwind.config.js` file is necessary for the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension to work properly. This configuration enables autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and other helpful features in your editor when working with Tailwind CSS classes. It does not need to be customized for this project, but must be present in the workspace.
